# **Optimizing Cancer Classification for Edge Devices Using TinyML**
![header image](resources/header.png)


## üìå **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a low-power, real-time cancer classification system using **TinyML** and deploying it on an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller. By leveraging RNA-Seq gene expression data, the project demonstrates how high-dimensional biomedical data can be preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled to predict different types of cancer. The final model is optimized and converted into a lightweight format suitable for embedded environments.

## üß¨ **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains **gene expression levels** for thousands of genes measured using the **Illumina HiSeq platform**. Each row represents a biological sample, and each column corresponds to a specific gene. A separate file provides **cancer type labels** for each sample.

- **Number of Samples**: Rows in the dataset represent unique patient samples.
- **Number of Features**: 20,531 gene expression attributes (gene_0 to gene_20530).
- **Classes**: 
  - **`PRAD`**: Prostate Adenocarcinoma  
  - **`LUAD`**: Lung Adenocarcinoma  
  - **`BRCA`**: Breast Cancer  
  - **`KIRC`**: Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma  
  - **`COAD`**: Colon Adenocarcinoma
